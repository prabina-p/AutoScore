58,What are the main advantages associated with object-oriented programming?,"Modularability, the ability to reuse parts of the program later in another program sometimes with completely different goals for the program. Also it makes it easier to debug code by dividing up the code into classes that each do a specific job and when the program fails at one job you only have one class to debug. Good for security purposes because it allows you to let someone use a program which sorts lists without having to give them access to the source code. ALso allows you to use inheritance and polymorphism.",0

When debugging the program it is easier to track down the source of a problem within a module rather than a 2 million line program.",0

The code itself also looks more organized and is easier to read and will help to avoid redundant coding.  Post-programming maintenance is also easier.  Also, modules can be reused several times in other programs without too much hassle.   Abstraction is the art of breaking down one big problem into smaller, simpler problems and solving them.  Many of the smaller problems are shared between unique complex problems, and creating modules to these solve these smaller repeated problems can save time when you encounter them again.",0

The function prototype, by common practice is placed at the beginning of the program after the #includes and before main( ). The FUNCTION DEFINITION is the guts of the function. This is where the programmer decides what the function is going to do and tells it how to do it. It takes whatever information it is given and performs the operations.

1390,How are infix expressions evaluated by computers?,"Writing arithmetic expressions is called infix notation.  This is because a binary operator (like '+') is written in between its two operands (as in ""a + b"").  There are two alternative forms of notation used in certain situations.  One is prefix notation, in which an operator is written before its operands.  In prefix notation, the sum of a and b is written ""+ a b"".  This is the notation used to write function calls in mathematics and computer science.  It is also used in the Lisp and Scheme programming languages.  In postfix notation, an operator is written after its operands.  The sum of a and b is written ""a b +"".  (You may have seen this as ""reverse Polish notation"".)  Postfix notation forms the conceptual basis for the way that arithmetic expressions are evaluated by a computer.  One important characteristic of both postfix and prefix notations is that they are unambiguous; no parentheses are needed to indicate the order of operations. ",0

2258,How many steps does it take to search a node in a binary search tree?,"If the binary search tree is constructed efficiently, best case scenario is O(log n) time.  Where n is the number of items in the tree.  If the binary search tree is constructed poorly, with for instance the root of the tree being 1, and progressing downwards and to the right its children are each more than the last: you have a one-way linear linked list.  That worse case scenario would be a full traversal at O(n) time. Where n is the number of items in the tree.",0
