1.3,What are the main advantages associated with object-oriented programming?,Abstraction and reusability.,"Coding and Debugging programs are usually easier, as either the compiler will specify the object that is working incorrectly, or the function an object was assigned to will be easier to identify.  The code itself also looks more organized and is easier to read and will help to avoid redundant coding.  Post-programming maintenance is also easier.  Also, modules can be reused several times in other programs without too much hassle.   Abstraction is the art of breaking down one big problem into smaller, simpler problems and solving them.

This is because a binary operator (like '+') is written in between its two operands (as in ""a + b"").  There are two alternative forms of notation used in certain situations.  One is prefix notation, in which an operator is written before its operands.  In prefix notation, the sum of a and b is written ""+ a b"".  This is the notation used to write function calls in mathematics and computer science.  It is also used in the Lisp and Scheme programming languages.  In postfix notation, an operator is written after its operands.  The sum of a and b is written ""a b +"".  (You may have seen this as ""reverse Polish notation"".)  Postfix notation forms the conceptual basis for the way that arithmetic expressions are evaluated by a computer.  One important characteristic of both postfix and prefix notations is that they are unambiguous; no parentheses are needed to indicate the order of operations. ",5,5,5
